## Adding new year of data

### 1. Access the repository

1. Download Github Desktop
    <https://desktop.github.com>
2. Open Github Desktop and select Clone repository from internet
3. Sign In using Github.com account
4. Repositories should be shown now, including jpjosephh/spark-digital-equity. Click that link and clone.

### 2. Getting data in usable form

There is examples of what the final CSV file should look like in the repository. To access them:

1. In Github Desktop, have the spark-digital-equity repository open
2. Click on view files in respository in Finder (may be different option for non macOS users)
3. Click into the src folder, then the data folder, and finally the Excel folder
4. 2017.csv is the format that all CSV files should be in. You can create this csv file manually from all of the excel sheets given. If there is someone experienced with python and pandas, there is a juypter notebook in the data-processing folder that can be used to take the different CSV files and turn it into one.
5. Manually add in the Massachusetts row by summing all the columns. Refer to the 2017.CSV file to see the format
6. Go to <http://convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm> and in input, select the CSV file you are adding
7. Select the option CSV to JSON Array
8. Download the Results and save as Year.json, assume for this example we are assing 2019 data, so 2019.json
9. Ensure that empty fields are saved as null, not {}. If empty field values are saved as {}, use Find and Replace to replace with null.

### 3. Editing the repository

1. Go back to where the project is saved on the computer
2. In the folder spark-digital-equity/data-processing/initial_data add the file in the format of year.json (ex. 2019.json)
    - the json file should be formatted with following following columns
        - STUDENTS_ENROLLED
        - AA 
        - AS 
        - District 
        - ELL
        - EcoDis
        - FEMALE
        - HI
        - MALE
        - MR
        - NA
        - NH_PI
        - NONBINARY
        - ORG_CODE
        - SWD
        - SY
        - School Code
        - School Name
        - Score=1
        - Score=2
        - Score=3
        - Score=4
        - Score=5
        - Tests Taken
        - WH

3. Add the corresponding year to the year array in the year.js file under the path of src/data/year.js - example below

    ```javascript
    var year = [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019]
    ```
4. Run the python script data_process.py inside of the data_processing folder (make sure to have python installed). This will populate the final_data.json file with the new data file added in. 

    ```bash
    python3 data-processing/data_process.py
    ```
